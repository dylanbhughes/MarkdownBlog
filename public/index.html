        Yeah I went ahead and wrote one of these things. If you're interested in my work as a software engineer check out my personal site at <a href="http://www.dylanbhughes.io">dylanbhughes.io</a>.

<h1>Hello, World! - March 28th, 2016</h1>
<hr>
<p>So let me take a moment to explain what exactly I'm doing here. I built this basic blog engine mainly because I despise writing for long periods in the browser anywhere other than a google doc and that's a terrible way to blog. I decided instead to write in markdown because markdown is <em>the best</em>.</p>
<p>I can do all sorts of fun things in markdown without having to stop typing. I can include code snippets, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">() =&gt; {
  console.log('And I never had to stop typing or leave atom!');
}
</code></pre>
<p>So there's a lot that I really like about markdown. People have written whole books in it (Looking at you, <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/README.md">getify</a>). It's also a great way to collaborate on a written work. I sent getify a pull request for his book one time. It was awesome.</p>
