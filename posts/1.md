# Hello, World! - March 28th, 2016
----------------

So let me take a moment to explain what exactly I'm doing here. I built this basic blog engine mainly because I despise writing for long periods in the browser anywhere other than a google doc and that's a terrible way to blog. I decided instead to write in markdown because markdown is *the best*.

I can do all sorts of fun things in markdown without having to stop typing. I can include code snippets, like so:

```js
() => {
  console.log('And I never had to stop typing or leave atom!');
}
```

So there's a lot that I really like about markdown. People have written whole books in it (looking at you, [getify](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/README.md )). It's also a great way to collaborate on a written work. I sent getify a pull request for his book one time. It was awesome.
