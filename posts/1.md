# Hello, World! - March 28th, 2016

So let me take a moment to explain what exactly I'm doing here. I built this basic blog engine mainly because I despise writing for long periods in the browser anywhere other than a google doc and that's a terrible way to blog. I decided instead to write in markdown because markdown is *the best*.

I can do all sorts of fun things in markdown without having to stop typing. I can include ```code``` snippets, like so:

```javascript
() => {
  console.log('And I never had to stop typing or leave atom!');
}
```

Now let's try some HTML:

```html
<div class="demo">
  <h1>This is a demo!</h1>
</div>
```

So there's a lot that I really like about markdown. People have written whole books in it (looking at you, [getify](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/README.md )). It's also a great way to collaborate on a written work. I sent getify a pull request for his book one time. It was awesome.

I can also use some other things in markdown like:

* Bullet points

1. Ordered Lists

## Sub headings

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There's a whole lot you can do with md without ever leaving your text editor. Just because I'm a swell guy, here's a [helpful cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images).

So yeah, this is all the cool little stuff you can do with markdown. I think it's a great way to write. I'm going to use this to try and get some of my more public-friendly ideas out there. I'll also be unapologetically technical.
