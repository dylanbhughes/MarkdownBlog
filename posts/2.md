# Unapologetically Technical

There's an idea that's begun to bother me more and more lately. This may sound like just another rich white kid bitching that people need to be informed about the particular field that he's in. And it is. But bear with me.

I was reading an article in The Verge today where the author described a presentation by a Chinese phone manufacturer as "unapologetically technical". The direct quote from [the article](http://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11420304/xiaomi-huawei-meizu-china-smartphone-communication) is:

> "The company's slides were rich on arcane initialisms like DTI and UFS, and its pitch was unapologetically technical. Specs are good, Xiaomi seemed to be saying, and we have some of the best ones around."

This quote really socked me in the gut for some reason. I found myself wondering, "It's a presentation on a smartphone, why would they have to apologize for being technical at all?"

Then I remembered back to my first real job. My first terrible career choice was at Accenture Federal Services, where I was a Technical Operations Associate for 8 months. I remembered meetings with the business team, where they'd say things like "well, I'm not technical" or "can you say that in english". My favorite was the classic smug grin of "what a nerd, I understand nothing coming out of his mouth right now." Here's the kicker: our job was to run two systems for the Department of Education. First, we made studentloans.gov. Second, we made Common Origination and Disbursement, the application that takes all of the taxpayer/government money allocated for student loans and distributes it to universities across the country. So, our systems distributed millions of dollars of taxpayer money every year. These are the people that aren't "technical".

Let me clarify. I'm not asking these people to build me an app. I just thought that terms like "logs" and "latency" may be good things for them to know. Or, you know, a basic understanding of how the internet works. What an operating system is. Something.

But I eventually came to realize that the "consultants", the self-described backbone of Accenture, didn't *want* to be technical. They wanted to be the opposite of technical. They wanted to have no fucking idea what I was saying. And they had a damn good reason for this desire: the consultants, not the engineers, get paid. I came to find out that an entry-level federal consultant at Accenture made (and probably still makes) $20,000 more than an engineer. The client-facing yet ignorant arm of the firm were the moneymakers. They bring home the bacon. They win the contracts. What we built and who we get to run the applications don't matter because the contract has already been won.

At its core, Accenture isn't an engineering firm. And it's charging the government way more than it needs. It needed about 350 somewhat competent people to run two sites that could probably have been run effectively by a team of 45 good ones. But 350 = more man hours.

What's even funnier is that I could probably automate most of their jobs.

That is a serious statement. Knowing what I know now, I'm arguing that I could replace most of the workers on that project with sufficiently robust algorithms. You'd still need humans on the account, to be sure. But you could probably get away with 20. Maybe we'll take 45 as my estimate assuming that the actual head of the account does need some consultants to interface with the client and so forth. Most of the cuts would come from the operations teams. My team would totally be axed, along with most of the biz ops team, the HR Department (fewer people means fewer support persons, right?) and middle management.

Funnily enough, most of the people we've cut are the "non-technical" people.

If we assume that we have to pay some of the people that we keep more (to get better engineers) than let's double the salaries of our 20 or so engineers that we keep. Originally, let's say we have 5 entry level at 55,000, 6 slightly more senior at $65,000, 4 leads at $115,000, and 5 architect/management at $220,000 (a very liberal estimate). That's $2,225,000 per year. Doubled that's $4,450,000.

And that's not even what Accenture was actually charging the Department of Education per hour. To clarify, Accenture employees make an hourly wage and they record how many hours they work. Accenture, obviously, charges the government more than double what they're paying the employees per hour. Look at that figure again. That's only what the employees *took home*.

Let's treat the employee hourly rate like a salary. Just for shits. Then, let's assume the business people who stay on the account make $1,000,000 more to accommodate the additional workload, and then we assume that everyone else that we've cut was making my salary of $55,000 (which is laughably low, but whatever let's go for it).

The extra 300 people cost the taxpayer exactly $14,500,000. Minus the extra million to the biz people that's $13,500,000.

We've just saved the people $13,500,000 by automating all of those jobs. And I can prove, systematically, that those jobs can be done by development tools and decent algorithms that our now well-paid engineers can build relatively quickly.

Sure, I accept your counterargument that I'm wrong and that we can't possibly automate all of those jobs, *today*. What about five years from now?

So, this really isn't a rant just about Accenture. This is about automation in general. Because the funny thing about automation is that if you spend time doing it early on it can cut a lot of the work you would do later.

Laurie Voss, CTO of npm, recently gave a talk to my cohort at MakerSquare. It was awesome. Anyway, he described the problem this way:

>Let's say that you spend all day typing. And you're bad at it. You type at 30 words per minute. Let's say you have 12 months of work to do where it'll be mostly typing. Intuitively you think you should start work right away, right? Because you're bad at typing.
>Actually, if you spent the first month of the project doing nothing but learning to type just 10 words per minute faster, you wouldn't have lost any time. If you really push yourself and get up to 50 words per minute, you've given yourself *extra time*.
-Totally Paraphrasing Laurie Voss

So if you give me a project that would take a person one day every month and I spend a week or two writing a good piece of software that can do it in five minutes every time it needs to be done *forever*, who wins? Because once I can automate enough of that employee's tasks, we really don't need that employee anymore.

If your job seems full of tasks that you have to do repetitively, we'll be able to automate your entire job within a few years. Fast food workers, sure, they'll be axed when automation becomes cheap enough. But it's not just them. Five years from now, I'll bet that natural language programming will have advanced enough to automate the job of a first year associate at a law firm. Lawyers will be able to verbally ask for a summary on a particular case or issue or whatever thing associates are told to go look up and the machine will return all relevant cases and an opinionated summary of both sides of the issues in five minutes. Imagine how many law students would be just so royally screwed due to debt.

So if someone is encouraging an environment where we're afraid of the "technicals" at a presentation on smartphones, I think they should consider the repercussions that attitude is going to have a few years down the road.
