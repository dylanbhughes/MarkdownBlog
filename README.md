# Markdown Blog Engine #
A blog engine for developers who like to write in Github README markdown.

## Summary
I hate typing into browsers. I like having drafts of the things I write on my filesystem or on Github. But here's the kicker: Github makes a terrible blog. Unless you're writing the whole damn book on JS (Looking at you Getify) it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to make the place you store your public repos into a blog. Also it's an ugly way to navigate a blog. Enter the Markdown Blog. This blog solves the ugly and UX problems of using Github to blog with a snazzy UI and navigation by date as well as server-side rendering for fast page loads. Simple add your .md file to the /posts folder on your server's filesystem and presto, a new post!

## Solution ##
