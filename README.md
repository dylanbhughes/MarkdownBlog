# Markdown Blog Engine #
A blog engine for developers who like to write in Github README markdown.

## Summary
I hate typing into browsers. I like having drafts of the things I write on my filesystem or on Github. But here's the kicker: Github makes a terrible blog. Unless you're writing the whole damn book on JS (Looking at you Getify) it doesn't make a whole lot of sense to make the place you store your public repos into a blog. Also it's an ugly way to navigate a blog. Enter the Markdown Blog. This blog solves the ugly and UX problems of using Github to blog with a snazzy UI and navigation by date as well as server-side rendering for fast page loads. Simple add your .md file to the /posts folder on your server's filesystem and presto, a new post!

## Problem
So typing in a browser is terrible. As developers, we all have our favorite TextEditors, IDEs, etc. that we use with our own custom settings. We have things set up a certain way for a certain reason. If we want to sit down and write, it makes sense for us to use our own editor that we feel comfortable with. I'm sure Medium's UX is lovely but it doesn't have my atom packages now does it?

For developers who like Github's .md parser writing a beautifully structured README can be a no-brainer. There are whole books (-cough- You Don't Know JS -cough-) written in markdown on Github. The problem is that Github makes a terrible blog. It's hard to navigate from post to post, to find a post from a certain date, and impossible to integrate into a personal site well.

## Solution ##
Markdown blog. Using Github's parsing algorithm as inspiration, this blog engine generates beautiful posts from .md files in your server's filesystem. Simply fork, customize with your name and CSS, and deploy a beautiful blog in minutes.
